-- Performing Test HAVE_STDATOMIC - Success
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:608 (find_package):
  Found package configuration file:

    /usr/lib/cmake/Qt6/Qt6Config.cmake

  but it set Qt6_FOUND to FALSE so package "Qt6" is considered to be NOT
  FOUND.  Reason given by package:

  Failed to find required Qt component "Core5Compat".

  Expected Config file at
  "/usr/lib/cmake/Qt6Core5Compat/Qt6Core5CompatConfig.cmake" does NOT exist

  Configuring with --debug-find-pkg=Qt6Core5Compat might reveal details why
  the package was not found.

  Configuring with -DQT_DEBUG_FIND_PACKAGE=ON will print the values of some
  of the path variables that find_package uses to try and find the package.
